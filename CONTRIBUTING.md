# Contributing

If you wish to contribute to the Vidclip codebase or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a
pull request. We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice
is a great boon to your development process.

To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install packages
4. Code your heart out
5. Run `npm build` to build TypeScript
6. Run `npm test` to run Jest and Prettier
7. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/realyoterry/vidclip/compare) (Make sure you follow the [conventional commit format](https://github.com/realyoterry/vidclip/blob/main/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md))
